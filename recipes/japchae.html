            <h4>Noodle Prep</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Put glass noodles in hot water for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove the water and keep noodles to the side, letting them soften.</li>
                </ol>
                
            <h4>Meat Prep</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut protein into thin sticks, about 1/4-inch wide, going against the grain or fibers.</li>
                    <li>Mix protein with soy sauce, sugar, and sweet rice wine. Leave on side to marinate.</li>
                </ol>

            <h4>Sauce Prep</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix all the sauce seasoning ingredients in a bowl and keep to the side.</li>
                </ol>

            <h4>Cooking Veggies</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Warm up oil in a big pan on medium-high. Put in onions, carrots, peppers, and a salt to taste. Cook until soft but with a slight crunch.</li>
                    <li>Add shiitake and more salt, cook until soft. If it get's too dry, add more oil.</li>
                    <li>Towards the end, add in spinach and cook it down until soft. Then remove everything from the pan and put it on a big plate to cool.</li>
                </ol>

            <h4>Cooking Meat</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the pan up on high. Add oil and then protein, cooking until done. Move the meat to the plate but leaving cooking juices in pan.</li>
                </ol>

            <h4>Final Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Put the cooked noodles into the pan with the prepared sauce, mixing everything. Cook until the noodles are very soft and the sauce is soaked up by the noodles. (3-4 minutes)</li>
                    <li>Toss everything together in the pan with the heat on low. Add sesame oil and seeds, mixing again. Check taste and adjust.</li>
